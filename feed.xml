      <title>I NEVER Thought Cooler Master Could do This!</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The gaming peripherals market is filled with a lot of copycats but also the opinions from a lot of keyboard and mouse enthusiasts.  The best gaming keyboards and the best gaming mice do something different and are designed based on community feedback.  That&#x27;s what Cooler Master is doing with the MM731 which could be the world&#x27;s lightest wireless gaming mouse and MK721.  IF they follow through, these could be some of the best peripherals for gaming and productivity.
