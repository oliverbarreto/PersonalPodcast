Apple&#x27;s M1 Mac Mini has already outperformed our $2,550 iMac 5K 2020 in many different performance tasks, so let&#x27;s pit it against the 2019 Mac Pro!

M1 Mac Mini vs 2020 5K iMac ➡ https://youtu.be/Mf7WY4UkFV4
M1 Mac Mini vs Intel i7 Mac Mini ➡ https://youtu.be/59gAjXT7qyw

Keep in mind that this is Apple&#x27;s very FIRST Apple Silicon SoC for the Mac, and it&#x27;s performing so well!

In this video, we compare a bunch of different performance tasks like Final Cut Pro, Xcode, app startup time like Lightroom Classic and Photoshop, Audacity, audio de-noising and more!
