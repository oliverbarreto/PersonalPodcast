      <title>4 ONE-MINUTE Habits That Save Me 20+ Hours a Week - Time Management For Busy People - Liam Porritt</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The first 100 people to download Endel will get a free week of audio experiences - https://app.adjust.com/b8wxub6?campaign=liamporritt_January2023&amp;adgroup=youtube

In our busy lives, a few hours a week means time for a date, or a few hours of self-love pruning in the bath - so imagine what you could do with 10, 20 or even more extra time each week 🤯 

Well, from reading some of the best time management books out there, these are my top 4 quick habits to efficiently manage your time, which save me hours each week 🙌 They are simple, but hugely effective techniques to make the most of our 16 or so waking hours a day, and honestly are some of the core techniques that allow me to keep up a demanding career as a corporate lawyer, while running multiple businesses on the side 👨‍💻

The key to these habits is (as with all habits) consistency… kinda obvious, I know. But with these habits especially, they really don’t take much effort, but they do require a consistent consciousness of how you are working. So, try to keep each of these in mind as you get ready for, and then during, each of your work sessions 🫶

About Me

I&#x27;m a lawyer, part-time YouTuber, son, brother, startup founder, fiancé, black coffee drinker and plant dad. I graduated from Cambridge University (where I studied French and Spanish), topped my law school class and now work for a corporate law firm in London as a trainee solicitor (which takes up a lot of my time)!

Around that, I&#x27;m a big fan of discovering new ways of thinking, of balancing work with life, and of performing to the very best of my ability. Ohh, and being happy. And I try to share all that on this YouTube channel 😀

Fun fact: I believe we massively overplay the role of “natural talent” 😮 AND… I also believe that TOGETHER, WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF POSITIVITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND SUCCESS.
