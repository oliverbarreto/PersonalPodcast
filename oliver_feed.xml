Welcome to another eye-opening episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu. Today, we delve into the looming economic turbulence with financial expert Peter Schiff. In this episode, titled &quot;We&#x27;re On The Brink Of Collapse - How The Everything Bubble Will Crash The Economy,&quot; we explore the potential downfall of the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency and its ripple effects on inflation and consumer goods.

Peter Schiff pulls no punches as he shares his insights on the monumental challenge of rebuilding U.S. manufacturing amidst high government regulations and taxes. He reveals the stark contrast between government-reported economic health and the reality of high inflation, unemployment, and a contracting economy. We discuss the power of media and political manipulation of public perception and the true cost of inflation, equating price increases to a hidden tax burdening citizens.

Schiff discusses strategic steps to protect your wealth, including investing in high-dividend, inflation-resistant companies globally, and stockpiling non-perishable goods. Additionally, he highlights the dangerous potential for a sudden, severe inflation spike and the importance of diversifying investments into precious metals and foreign markets.

We also cover the broader impacts of the U.S.&#x27;s economic policies on global trade and the precarious position of the dollar. Schiff argues for a return to the gold standard, scrutinizes contemporary political promises, and the implications of price controls, predicting a future where inflation accelerates and living costs soar.

Join us as we navigate these complex financial landscapes and uncover strategies to safeguard your financial future in uncertain times. Whether you&#x27;re an investor, a concerned citizen, or someone passionate about economic policy, this episode is packed with crucial insights and practical advice. Stay tuned!

Traditional roles for men and women in both personal and professional contexts are rapidly changing, and if you want to play the dating game to win and find a mate, you need to understand what makes women tick and how to be authentic while also desirable and irresistible. 

In today‚Äôs episode of Impact Theory, I‚Äôm joined by my wife Lisa Bilyeu for a super deep, insightful conversation around what women actually desire in a guy and WHY; how to become irresistible to the opposite sex; and the complexities of personal choices in the context of societal expectations, gender roles, and personal fulfillment.

Lisa Bilyeu is an entrepreneur, producer, best-selling author, public speaker, and host inspiring and empowering women (and men!) to build their confidence and change their life. Lisa co-founded the billion-dollar brand Quest Nutrition, is co-founder and president of Impact Theory Studios, and she has built a global audience while creating an impressive slate of content that has been viewed over half a billion times.

Be sure to get your copy of Lisa‚Äôs recently updated book, Radical Confidence, here: https://radicalconfidence.com/

We are digging deep into: 
- the intricacies of deciding NOT to have children in your relationship
- effects of societal pressures on individual decisions
- dynamics of a healthy relationship
- the struggles and fulfillment that come with ANY decision
- impacts of birth control on relationship dynamics
- shifting perceptions of relationships in modern times
- platforms like OnlyFans and their role in changing the dynamics of sexuality and personal expression
- the concept of &quot;hypergamy&quot; and societal views on relationships
- need for self-awareness and courage to pursue your ideal life
- the importance of communication and mutual respect in relationships

Lisa and I also go head to head as we explore how platforms like OnlyFans can be both empowering and exploitative, the most effective the decision-making processes you can use when it comes to big decisions, and the importance of making your own choices without fear of external criticism.

      <title>CIA Spy: "This Could Spark WW3 In 2024"- China's Takeover &amp; Iran-Israel-Palestine |Andrew Bustamante - Tom Bilyeu</title>

AG1: 

On today‚Äôs episode of Impact Theory, former CIA spy Andrew Bustamante and I are delving deep into the unsettling realities of our chaotic world. 

Andrew is sharing invaluable insights from his time as a CIA spy, offering a unique perspective on the distressing prospect of America turning against itself and the increasing potential for war. We also get Andrew‚Äôs ideas on how external attacks on our system could ironically unify us, but also how these threats are being weaponized to destabilize America. 

We also touch on: 
- How the new world power transition plays out over the next 10 years 
- The bloodless war in China to keep your eye on
- Foreign power influence in US elections
- U.S. domestic and foreign policy challenges
- The need for U.S. policy reassessment in the Middle East
- Historical solutions and their applicability to current conflicts
- The strategic, economic, and military partnership between the U.S. and Israel
- The plight of Palestinian people and potential solutions
- Analysis of historical superpower phases and predictions based on economic cycles
- Impact of espionage on global politics
- The role of cultural understanding and unity in addressing international threats and conflicts

It‚Äôs near impossible to not be impacted on various levels by the role of the internet in accelerating the velocity of information. 

It‚Äôs near impossible to not be impacted on various levels by the role of the internet in accelerating the velocity of information. We‚Äôre in a time where enabling psychological manipulation on a massive scale is happening right now as we speak. 

As we face an increasingly complex and confusing era, understanding the tactics and strategies used to manipulate you has never been more crucial.

Chapter Markers:

[0:00] Economic cycle predicts war

[1:10:53] Negotiation for off ramps amid Ukraine crisis
[1:34:28] Secret espionage warfare
[1:51:50] Trump vs. Biden Chaos


Powerful Insights From Andrew Bustamante:

‚ÄúThe way that you defeat extremism is by taking out the first step in the ladder.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen most people reference World War 3 happening, what they‚Äôre actually talking about is a nuclear war similar to how World War 2 ended. Wars evolve like people evolve, and if you‚Äôve seen the evolution of technology you can imagine how much more advanced World War 3 would be than World War 2‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHuman beings are wired to survive. We are not wired to thrive. We are wired to survive‚Äù

&quot;And of course, the United States is okay with that too, because it means there&#x27;s never going to be a military competitor in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a result. What does get to happen is those countries can take all the money that they would spend on military defense and channel it into intelligence operations.&quot;

&quot;So whatever happens, human beings will survive, will adapt, and will survive.&quot;

&quot;Ideology aside, if we want to protect American lives, we have to ensure the long term longevity, support and close relationships with the Israeli people and with the country of Israel. That is my official position.&quot;

&quot;When the United States cut off Russian bank accounts as part of their sanctions against Russia, and they cut off access to Russian funds that were denominated in euros and dollars, that was an economic warfare move.&quot;

&quot;Well, during those 20 years, while we were mastering the art of hunting terrorism, hunting terrorists in mountains in Pakistan and Afghanistan, what were our global power competitors doing? Was Russia engaged in the global war on terror? Was China involved in the global war on terror? So all the hundreds of billions of dollars that we spent in that war, we spent in a war that was a giant distraction for us, that gave our closest near peer competitors 20 years to invest their money and grow, to become a larger threat than we were even aware they were becoming.&quot;

      <title>"Don't Learn to Code, But Study This Instead..." says NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang - Goda Go</title>
      <description><![CDATA[I think a lot of people got it wrong what Jensen Huang, Co-Founder and CEO of NVIDIA was recently saying at the @WorldGovSummit . It is easy to grab a &quot;hot&quot; statement without considering the full context and the more important message about what we as humanity should focus more in the age of AI. 

I understand that most people don&#x27;t have time to sit through the full interview , thus my hope is that this video provides a better context without creating unnecessary additional anxiety that we are all so familiar now in the face of AI and rapid change.

‚û§‚û§Transcript (partial):
Part of spiritual development is to recognize the Satanic tendencies that characterize you and to fully wrestle with them and to‚Äî and to integrate them. That&#x27;s the thing. It&#x27;s‚Äîit‚Äôs not so much to cast them away. It&#x27;s to transmute them, you know. And you can see the difference between people who&#x27;ve done that and people who haven&#x27;t, at least to some degree, because people who haven&#x27;t integrated the shadow at all are naive. And you can tell that when you look at them and you can tell that when you talk to them. And because they&#x27;re naive, they&#x27;re often resentful as well because they get taken advantage of. And someone who&#x27;s integrated that more, they&#x27;re dangerous in the‚Äîin the martial arts sort of way, which is they&#x27;re dangerous, but they don&#x27;t have to be. They don&#x27;t have to use it because their presence radiates implicit potential for havoc. And that&#x27;s really necessary. It&#x27;s one of the things that gives people self-respect. If you&#x27;re harmless, you&#x27;re not virtuous. You&#x27;re just harmless. You&#x27;re like a rabbit. A rabbit isn&#x27;t virtuous. It&#x27;s just... It just can&#x27;t do anything except get eaten! It&#x27;s not virtuous. If you&#x27;re a monster and you don&#x27;t act monstrously, then you&#x27;re virtuous. But you also have to be a monster. Well, you see this all the time. Harry Potter is like that, too. It&#x27;s like he&#x27;s‚Äî he&#x27;s flawed, he&#x27;s hurt. He&#x27;s got evil in him. He can talk to snakes, man. He breaks rules all the time. All the time. He&#x27;s not obedient at all. But, you know, he has a good reason for breaking the rules. And if he couldn&#x27;t break the rules, him and his little clique of rule breaking, you know, troublemakers, if they didn&#x27;t break the rules, they wouldn&#x27;t attain the highest goal. So it&#x27;s very peculiar, but it&#x27;s a very, very, very, very common mythological notion. You know, the hero has to be... The hero has to be a monster. But a controlled monster. Batman is like that, you know? I mean, it&#x27;s‚Äîit&#x27;s everywhere. It&#x27;s‚Äîit&#x27;s the story you always hear. If you&#x27;re going to be a fighter, you have to want to win and you have to want to hurt people. I mean, not for the sake of hurting them. That&#x27;s what makes you different than an evil person. But you have to have that capacity. You have to develop that. And, you know, that&#x27;s a step on the way to enlightenment, weirdly enough, because that isn&#x27;t what people think. People have been fed this diet of pablum, rights and impulsive freedom for so long. There&#x27;s just an absolute starvation for the other side of the story. There are no rights, technically speaking, without responsibilities. And all we&#x27;ve had for 60 years is a dialog about rights. Well, that leaves a hole on the other side of the story, and it&#x27;s a hole that‚Äî that‚Äôs in people&#x27;s hearts, essentially, because responsibility‚Äî well, perhaps that&#x27;s not more important than rights. Like I said, they&#x27;re they&#x27;re part and parcel of the same formula. But it&#x27;s in responsibility that most people find the meaning that sustains them through life. It&#x27;s not in happiness. It&#x27;s not in impulsive pleasure. Those things blow away at the first ill wind. But to adopt the responsibility for your own well-being and to try to put your family together and to try to serve your community and to try to seek for eternal truth and to live them‚Äî that&#x27;s the sort of thing that can ground you in‚Äî in your life enough so that you can withstand the difficulty of life. And when you tell people that, especially when you include yourself in the audience, let&#x27;s say, and you&#x27;re not finger waving from above, then everyone knows that it&#x27;s true. There&#x27;s been this attempt to identify masculine competence and‚Äî and power, let&#x27;s say, but mostly competence with tyranny. And that&#x27;s very, very hard on‚Äî on young men. It&#x27;s also hard on young women, for that matter. But it&#x27;s very helpful for people to hear that they should make themselves competent and dangerous and take their proper place in the world because it&#x27;s the alternative to being weak. And weak is not good. The people who shoot up the high schools, they&#x27;re weak. They&#x27;re weak. And life is a very difficult process.

      <title>The World Lied To You About Success, Money &amp; Power! - Escape Misery &amp; Suffering | Arthur Brooks - Tom Bilyeu</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Get Out of Your Head. Take Action Now! https://bit.ly/3M28lkA

Restart Your Life in 7 Days: https://bit.ly/3RgzVhi

‚ÄúLife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness‚Ä¶‚Äù

You‚Äôve heard this many times before, and yet have you ever wondered why life and liberty are automatically given and assumed while happiness isn‚Äôt . Why are millions of people around the world chasing happiness and very few ever ‚Äúcatch‚Äù it?

Arthur Brooks is a social scientist, Harvard professor, and bestselling author committed to helping people find success, happiness and deep meaning. He&#x27;s such a profound thought-leader in the space that he just released a book with Oprah called Build the Life You Want, The Art and Science of Getting Happier.

We explore a deeply thought-provoking conversation about the pursuit of happiness through progress, learning, and understanding. As simple as the idea of happiness seems on the surface, understanding the complexities of what it means to pursue it, relish tt, and define the meaning of it without attachment and dogmatic viewpoints escapes many people.

Some key areas we dive hard and deep on that I think you will find so interesting are:
1) The role of progress in human flourishing
2) The danger of being attached and dogmatic with your beliefs
3) The importance not allowing your views to define you

What I enjoyed most about our conversation was how far we explored and unpacked in areas that are potentially controversial topics like religious beliefs, political differences, and family schisms. Get ready to challenge your base assumptions and view existential threats from new angles.


ARTHUR BROOKS QUOTES:

‚ÄúThe idea that you can be blissful and happy all the time is not just unrealistic, it&#x27;s unhealthy. It would be terrible if you were happy all the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you don&#x27;t defend your positions, if you admit to the possibility that you&#x27;re not right, that you learn and you update when people say things that you think are crazy, you say, tell me more that you&#x27;re actually going to get better.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny time you use your values as a weapon, you&#x27;ve denigrated their moral content. You&#x27;ve eviscerated the effectiveness of your approach. But if you use your values as a gift it might not always be taken in a charitable way.‚Äù

‚ÄúEach of us is an entrepreneur in the startup of our lives. That&#x27;s what really matters. And what we need is to always have a clear intention‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThe best thing that you can possibly do is to think about the emotions that you&#x27;re feeling, what they mean and how best to use them.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAll the things we really want in life. All of our deep desires are complex. All of our solutions are complicated, and we&#x27;re throwing complicated solutions at complex problems and we&#x27;re not getting happier.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey&#x27;re not entrepreneurial in the part of life that matters the most, which is their heart.‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄúThe first one is that there is meaning. You need to find it and live up to it.‚Äù

Can humanity ever truly overcome evil? Can personal responsibility truly shape destiny in an interconnected world? Can society survive without traditional masculine virtues? Consider this your warning‚Ä¶

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson is a renowned psychologist, author, and online educator here to help us navigate the complex layers of thought, emotion, and spirit that compose the human condition. A Canadian clinical psychologist by profession, Jordan carved a unique path that intertwined academic rigor with deep reflections on morality, meaning, and belief. 

In today‚Äôs thought-provoking episode, Jordan is answering deep questions about life, purpose, and the potential for human transformation.

We touch on: 
- The line between good and evil
- Healthy vs. toxic masculinity
- Social media&#x27;s role in society&#x27;s rapid transformation
- Personal responsibility and the pursuit of meaning
- Cultural castration of men
- Human suffering and wrestling with God
- The challenges of conveying wisdom through religious narratives
- The OnlyFans dynamic 
- Genuine religious pursuit vs. exploitation for tyrannical ends
- Victimhood narratives and moral superiority

From the depths of human nature and the potential for totalitarianism, to the power of religious and philosophical insights in understanding the complexities of life, Jordan and I delve into the complex landscape of human psychology, ideology, and the search for meaning. 

Don‚Äôt miss this journey into the heart of what it means to be human, and confront your beliefs, fears, and moral compass in this episode of Impact Theory.

[1:51:02] Predators, oppressors, and power


Powerful Insights From Dr. Jordan B. Peterson:
&quot;If you don&#x27;t believe in something like the ultimate reality of evil, it&#x27;s just the Nazis went about things a slightly different way. Who&#x27;s to say what&#x27;s right or wrong?&quot;

&quot;It&#x27;s no wonder that we believe in the union of diversity when we believe that a man can be a woman. If we believe those things, there&#x27;s nothing we won&#x27;t swallow, no camel too big to go down our throats, no totalitarian lie we won&#x27;t rush to embody.&quot;

‚ÄúThere&#x27;s a vertical axis of orientation upward towards God, mediated by tradition, and there&#x27;s a horizontal axis that&#x27;s part of the ongoing conversation and consensus of the moment.&quot;

&quot;And so the world of images is going to have the same networked structure as the world of words that the LLMs have modeled. Soon the LLms will be able to model the world of images and soon they&#x27;ll be able to lay them on top of one another.&quot;

&quot;...everything you give away, you&#x27;ll get back if you give it away in the right spirit.&quot;

&quot;You give more than you&#x27;re called upon to give, even to your enemies. Why? Because there is no better strategy than that by any stretch of the imagination‚Ä¶How could you possibly put anything in a more solid bank than in the goodwill you generated in the embodied imaginations of other people? That&#x27;s the kingdom.&quot;

I have never put out an urgent episode before. I recorded this conversation 5 days ago with the incredible Mo Gawdat. After our conversation, I realised how urgent this information is and how critical it is that we are all aware of the super-intelligence of AI.

Mo Gawdat is the Former Chief Business Officer for Google X, an AI expert, a best-selling author and a passionate podcaster.

Mo spoke to me about AI. Most people bury their head in the sand when it comes to this topic, Mo is trying to change that. He believes that AI can be used for good, however we all need to work together to make that happen. 

This episode is incredibly important. If you have any loved ones or people you care about, make sure you send this on to them. I urge you to listen carefully and then take action.

      <title>Designing a Customer-Centric Business Model - Harvard Innovation Labs</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Simply defined, a business model is how you deliver value to customers and how you make money in return.

      <title>CIA Spy On WW3, Jeffrey Epstein, Israel-Hamas, AI &amp; Social Media Brainwashing | Andrew Bustamante - Tom Bilyeu</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Transform Your Life in 90 Days: Take The Impact 90 Challenge  https://bit.ly/47kCfrZ

This episode is sponsored by Aura. You can try Aura for free for two weeks at https://bit.ly/3KJd7mC. The Smart, Simple Way To Stay Safe Online.

We&#x27;re delving deep into the unsettling realities of our chaotic world with former CIA spy, Andrew Bustamante. As we face an increasingly complex and confusing era, understanding the tactics and strategies used to manipulate public opinion has never been more crucial.

In this episode, we examine the distressing prospect of America turning against itself and the increasing potential for war. Andrew shares his ideas on how external attacks on our system could ironically unify us, but also how these threats are being weaponized to destabilize America. We look at the concept of World War 3 and it not being fought on traditional battlefields, but through proxy wars and influence campaigns that target our resources, dominance, and global standing.

It‚Äôs near impossible that you are not impacted on various levels by the role of the internet in accelerating the velocity of information. We‚Äôre in a time where enabling psychological manipulation on an unprecedented scale is happening right now as we speak.

How will you protect yourself? Will you learn how to think through novel problems and utilize opposing narratives against each other to discover the truth?

By the end of this episode, you‚Äôll learn how to anchor yourself, make clear-headed decisions, and avoid the trap of emotional decision-making. In listening to both sides of the political spectrum and finding common ground, we can cut through the &#x27;fog of war&#x27; and discern truth from noise.

Andrew Bustamante delivers invaluable insights from his time as a CIA spy, offering a unique perspective on the truth about Jeffrey Epstein, conspiracy theories, porn and sexpionage that will shock you!

Powerful Insights From Andrew Bustamante:

‚ÄúAt our core we are a fighting culture. It‚Äôs one of our biggest flaws and it‚Äôs one of our biggest strengths.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmotional decision making is what the human brain wants to do, [...] because emotional decisions require less cognitive ability, less calories, less time and is easier‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúTruth includes facts and beliefs, and facts excludes beliefs.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe way that you defeat extremism is by taking out the first step in the ladder.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen most people reference World War 3 happening, what they‚Äôre actually talking about is a nuclear war similar to how World War 2 ended. Wars evolve like people evolve, and if you‚Äôve seen the evolution of technology you can imagine how much more advanced World War 3 would be than World War 2‚Ä¶‚Äù

Al final, esta nueva sintaxis es como cuando React propuso los hooks y functional components en lugar de clases, o cuando Vue.Js introdujo el Composition API sobre el options API.

      <title>The 6 Habits Of HIGHLY EFFECTIVE People You Can Copy! (CHANGE EVERYTHING) | Brendon Burchard - Tom Bilyeu</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Build IRONCLAD discipline in this free workshop: https://bit.ly/3pMVl6J

On Today&#x27;s Episode: 

It‚Äôs easy to admire people that have reached extraordinary levels of success, it‚Äôs hard to imagine what it takes to get there. Passing off someone‚Äôs excellence and success as unattainable for ourselves is a b.s. and it‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre about at Impact Theory. 

Your beliefs are malleable and what you believe about yourself matters. How you decide to live your life and show today matters also and if you‚Äôre not happy with the way you show up or how you‚Äôre living your life then do something about it.

Brendon Burchard is one of the world‚Äôs leading high performance coaches that has impacted and trained millions of people globally. His online personal growth platform is dedicated to teaching people how to bring the joy, live with intention, love the life you live, and matter to yourself and others everyday because you show up to go all-in on whatever you decide.

You‚Äôve heard what it takes to be successful, but very few people share how to get beyond passion and shoot for obsession to attain insane levels of success, but today we are, so let‚Äôs go.

SHOW NOTES:

0:00 | Introduction to Brendon Burchard
2:22 | Generate the Energy You Want
10:15 | Raise Necessity with Obsession
15:51 | These 2 Things BUILD Your Identity
26:33 | Build These Skills Achieve More
35:47 | Honor the Struggle to Win

QUOTES:

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not a fun person when you&#x27;re broke, you‚Äôre not going to be that much more fun when you‚Äôre rich.‚Äù [4:00]

‚ÄúHigh performers are generating the energy, and that means the mental, emotional and physical energy, that they feel is necessary to serve with excellence in a certain situation.‚Äù [9:45]

‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt want to exude that much passion which becomes obsession because they‚Äôre fearful of their obsessions.‚Äù [12:36] 

‚ÄúIf no one thinks you‚Äôre crazy you‚Äôre not yet operating to the outer limits of your potential.‚Äù [13:43]

‚ÄúBeing obsessed about something that gives you no feedback is not scary, being obsessed about something, like trying to make an impact in the world you‚Äôre going to get feedback.‚Äù [14:39]

‚ÄúIf you want to win, your identity has to be tied into that thing in which you are trying to succeed at and give to, and that takes a lot of guts to ut yourself all in‚Ä¶‚Äù [18:32]

‚ÄúThis is who I‚Äôm going to be and I‚Äôm going to build into that, and it is necessary for me to become that person.‚Äù [26:22]

‚ÄúHigh performers are consistently seeking clarity in ‚Äòwho do I want to be?‚Äô [...] in every situation.‚Äù [31:15]

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a friction free life, [...] The journey to greatness begins the moment that our deep desires for comfort and for ease are overpowered by our desires to connect and contribute.‚Äù  [40:08]

‚ÄúDetermine what the questions at the end of your life are going to be.‚Äù [42:49]

      <title>MEGATHREAT: Why AI Is So Dangerous &amp; How It Could Destroy Humanity | Mo Gawdat - Tom Bilyeu</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Listen to Impact Theory on Amazon Music: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/9e0db1b9-b46c-4e50-a9c5-add34b0ffe00/impact-theory-with-tom-bilyeu?ref=dm_sh_nzgPULGEOD2WFqOCd38MsElYP

Restart Your Life in 7 Days: http://bit.ly/42KM8OR

After reading Mo Gawdat‚Äôs book, Scary Smart, I knew right away this conversation was a must. As I think about AI‚Äôs capabilities ‚Äì the good, the bad and possibly terrifying, I realize how serious this moment is in history for humanity.

Mo Gawdat is the former chief business officer for Google X and has built a monumental career in the tech industry working with the biggest names to reshape and reimagine the world as we know it. From IBM to Microsoft, Mo has lived at the cutting edge of technology and has taken a strong stance that AI is a bigger threat to humanity than global warming.

The AI dilemma is reshaping our future whether you‚Äôre in favor of it or not. The question is, are we even close to being prepared for humanity‚Äôs collision with artificial intelligence?

Strap in for the ride, we‚Äôre diving headfirst into this conversation and uncovering the alarming truth about how vulnerable we actually are and what that means for the next decade ahead.

QUOTES:

‚ÄúIt really is about a point of no return. Where if we cross that point of no return we have very little chance to bring the genie back into the bottle.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no shutting down AI, there is no reversing it, there is no stopping development of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never created a nuclear weapon that can create nuclear weapons.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe growth on the next chip in your phone is going to be a million times more than the computer that put people on the moon.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we ask computers to communicate, at first they communicate like we tell them, but if they&#x27;re intelligent enough, they&#x27;ll start to say, ‚Äòthat&#x27;s too slow.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúOne of our better scenarios, believe it or not, is that AI ignores us altogether.‚Äù

‚ÄúTechnology today can influence one human at a time.‚Äù

Build IRONCLAD discipline in this FREE workshop: https://bit.ly/3RUnYux

On Today&#x27;s Episode:

Do you enjoy the snooze alarm game? A lot of people you know including yourself do. It‚Äôs kind of fun but mostly torture. For 30 to 60 minutes, depending on your level of expertise, you get to see how many times you will hit the snooze button and sleep in 5 or 10 minute intervals before having to jump out of bed and mad dash through the morning to get ready. 

Every day, you wake up exhausted, you don‚Äôt get to the most important thing you told yourself the night before you would do first thing in the morning, your energy is low before noon and by 3 PM you‚Äôre begging yourself for a nap.

The key to breaking this cycle to start waking up at the time you want and need to is having the habits and routines built in place that make you so efficient that success becomes inevitable.

You don‚Äôt have to struggle every morning to get up early, you don‚Äôt need to set an alarm every night before bed to get up in the morning on time, and you don‚Äôt have to suffer through your days forever tired.

This is the video you need to hear to truly understand, how hardcore is hardcore for Tom Bilyeu when it comes to being the founder of a billion dollar company?

A few simple strategies you can start with right now are:

Go to bed same time (every day)
Do not use an alarm
Sleep as much as you need (it‚Äôs that important)

QUOTES:

‚ÄúYour life will change forever the moment you decide to go to us early and really attack your day.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe snooze alarm says that you‚Äôve not gotten control of your evenings.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need time to unwind, you are creating a torture cycle for yourself. You need a method for shutting your brain off.‚Äù

‚ÄúI define truth as the thing that most efficiently moves you towards your goal.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy life is an exact reflection of my choices and that I made my day a little bit worst by not doing what I said I was going to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúBoredom kills more dreams than failure I promise you.‚Äù

      <title>Chat GPT, The FUTURE Of AI And Is It The End Of Human Civilization? | Tom Bilyeu - Tom Bilyeu</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Click here to download your FREE guide to 100x YOUR EFFICIENCY IN 10 EASY STEPS: https://bit.ly/3F8qOJL

Chat GPT AI went from 0 to over 100Million users in less than 2 months. AI is super fucking dangerous, but it‚Äôs inevitable, will make our lives better, and you should CAREFULLY love it. 

Is AI dangerous? Next to thermonuclear war and an asteroid strike, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the most radically dangerous threat that we face as a species. Buuuuut I‚Äôm still super excited. And by the end of this video you will be too.

If you‚Äôre terrified of AI right now, you‚Äôre rational. If you‚Äôre not at least worried it will take a wrong turn into James Cameron territory, you‚Äôre not paying attention. To paraphrase Elon Musk, the human endeavor to create AI could be the first step towards a technological utopia or a demon summoning circle. It‚Äôs not clear which way it will go. But one thing is for sure, we will not control it. And he‚Äôs right, but the truth is, the genie is out of the bottle, and we‚Äôre going to have to deal with it.  

For the most part our insatiable drive for progress is awesome. The modern world really is a miracle. We have buses that fly for the love of god. And if people like Eric Weinstein are correct, our thirst for progress will lead us to building technology that doesn‚Äôt just allow us to fly around the world, it will give us the ability to manipulate time and space itself - propelling us well beyond our solar system at faster than light speeds. 


I fear it will be a bit of both.

AI, which simply stands for Artificial Intelligence, is getting smart. Really smart. And AI doesn‚Äôt have to outsmart us by much to completely dominate us. Let me give you an example for scale: A moron is technically someone with an IQ of about 70. The average IQ in the US is 98. Einstein was estimated to be 160. And according to the Guiness book of World Records, the highest IQ ever recorded came in at a whopping 210. That means that a super genius is only 3 times smarter than a moron. But Einstein, who was actually only 2.3 times smarter than a moron, had insights that gave birth to nuclear power and nuclear bombs, not to mention lasers, GPS, and a whole lot more. Said another way, a little intelligence goes a loooooooong way. 

Nuclear warheads are scary enough, but AI isn‚Äôt going to be a little smarter than Einstein, it‚Äôs going to be a LOT smarter. Not 5 times smarter or 10 times or even 10,000 times smarter. We‚Äôre talking millions of times smarter. 

Despite the reality of all the bad stuff that‚Äôs coming, here are three traps we must avoid.
1. Burying our heads in the sand. 
2. Panicking. 
3. Trying to abolish AI.

Panicking is the same as actively taking your own intelligence offline. When you panic, blood leaves your prefrontal cortex, which is the seat of high level cognition. Therefore it actually makes you dumber. And in the face of artificial super intelligence that strikes me as a very bad idea. 

This is going to be the bleakest thing that I say today, but if we‚Äôre going to walk a wise path forward, we‚Äôve got to face all of this. And, as they say, it‚Äôs darkest right before dawn, which I promise is coming. But first, here‚Äôs the reality you will instantly know to be true - when humans find powerful things we use them. 

Because AI as a weapon is a zero sum game. If only one nation develops it, it will be winner take all. And no one can risk an adversary getting Artificial Super Intelligence while they sit around entering funny prompts into ChatGPT. 

In the short term you need to do three things:

1. Reframe your thinking around AI. Don‚Äôt see it as the enemy. See it as a tool. You‚Äôre not going to be replaced by AI, at least not yet. You‚Äôre going to be replaced by a human using AI. Be the human that replaces others.
2. Figure out how AI is going to disrupt you. Face it head on. Don‚Äôt run. Don‚Äôt hide. Identify your vulnerabilities and shore up your skill set.
3. Identify all of the AI tools that are relevant to you and master them. Learn absolutely everything you can.

Remember, this is the very beginning of a very aggressive revolution. Moving quickly gives you advantages.

First of all, let me acknowledge that I‚Äôm a pundit here, not an expert. While we‚Äôre working feverishly to integrate AI into our company‚Äôs workflow, I‚Äôm not the guy who can tell you how AI works under the hood. So what follows will be me thinking out loud based on what I‚Äôve learned from the experts in my attempts to use AI in both my daily life and the daily operations of my company.]]></description>

      <title>4 ONE-MINUTE Habits That Save Me 20+ Hours a Week - Time Management For Busy People - Liam Porritt</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The first 100 people to download Endel will get a free week of audio experiences - https://app.adjust.com/b8wxub6?campaign=liamporritt_January2023&amp;adgroup=youtube

In our busy lives, a few hours a week means time for a date, or a few hours of self-love pruning in the bath - so imagine what you could do with 10, 20 or even more extra time each week ü§Ø 

Well, from reading some of the best time management books out there, these are my top 4 quick habits to efficiently manage your time, which save me hours each week üôå They are simple, but hugely effective techniques to make the most of our 16 or so waking hours a day, and honestly are some of the core techniques that allow me to keep up a demanding career as a corporate lawyer, while running multiple businesses on the side üë®‚Äçüíª

The key to these habits is (as with all habits) consistency‚Ä¶ kinda obvious, I know. But with these habits especially, they really don‚Äôt take much effort, but they do require a consistent consciousness of how you are working. So, try to keep each of these in mind as you get ready for, and then during, each of your work sessions ü´∂

About Me

I&#x27;m a lawyer, part-time YouTuber, son, brother, startup founder, fianc√©, black coffee drinker and plant dad. I graduated from Cambridge University (where I studied French and Spanish), topped my law school class and now work for a corporate law firm in London as a trainee solicitor (which takes up a lot of my time)!

Around that, I&#x27;m a big fan of discovering new ways of thinking, of balancing work with life, and of performing to the very best of my ability. Ohh, and being happy. And I try to share all that on this YouTube channel üòÄ

Fun fact: I believe we massively overplay the role of ‚Äúnatural talent‚Äù üòÆ AND‚Ä¶ I also believe that TOGETHER, WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF POSITIVITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND SUCCESS.
