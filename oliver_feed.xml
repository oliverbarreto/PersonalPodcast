      <title>Apple Data Protection — The ugly truth - Rene Ritchie</title>

Up until now, Apple kept an encryption key for things like your personal photos and messages stored on their iCloud servers. That meant, if you ever forgot your passcode or otherwise locked yourself out, Apple could recover that data for you. But, side effect, that also meant a government could subpoena them, or a super-villain could theoretically break in and steal them.

Now, in the US, and in more places over the course of the next year, we’ll have the option to turn on Advanced Data Protection for iCloud. In other words, turn off Apple’s ability to access almost everything on iCloud. literally make them throw their key away. Then, just like our health data and passwords have been, our photos and messages will be utterly, completely locked down.

But should they be? Should we actually turn advanced data protection on?

      <title>Finally — Should Apple buy Netflix? - Rene Ritchie</title>
      <description><![CDATA[🚀 Visit https://www.brilliant.org/reneritchie to start learning STEM for FREE! First 200 get 20% off their annual premium subscription!

Netflix is in trouble. Not for hiking prices more often than Ticketmaster does a Taylor Swift show. And not for canceling half your favorite series after a single season. Not because companies like Disney, Warners, Paramount, et. al have started competing services, and have either taken away high-retention content like Friends or are providing alternate, even cheaper places to get it. Not even for coming up with — and having to instantly walk back — the dumbest period password-sharing prevention period scheme period ever period. 

But for the exact same reason they’ve always been in trouble. The same reason that causes every rando analyst hungry for a clickbait headline to pop up like Van Gogh melting clockwork every few months to say Apple should buy them. Should buy Netflix.

Well, ok, technically the opposite reason

      <title>Apple Steve Jobs Heres To The Crazy Ones - Nathan Hulls</title>
      <description><![CDATA[http://www.NathanHulls.com

Steve Jobs narrates the first of Apples &#x27;Think Different&#x27; commercial &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Crazy Ones&quot;. It never aired. Richard Dreyfuss did the voice over for the original spot that aired.

&quot;The ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do&quot;

      <title>4 ONE-MINUTE Habits That Save Me 20+ Hours a Week - Time Management For Busy People - Liam Porritt</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The first 100 people to download Endel will get a free week of audio experiences - https://app.adjust.com/b8wxub6?campaign=liamporritt_January2023&amp;adgroup=youtube

In our busy lives, a few hours a week means time for a date, or a few hours of self-love pruning in the bath - so imagine what you could do with 10, 20 or even more extra time each week 🤯 

Well, from reading some of the best time management books out there, these are my top 4 quick habits to efficiently manage your time, which save me hours each week 🙌 They are simple, but hugely effective techniques to make the most of our 16 or so waking hours a day, and honestly are some of the core techniques that allow me to keep up a demanding career as a corporate lawyer, while running multiple businesses on the side 👨‍💻

The key to these habits is (as with all habits) consistency… kinda obvious, I know. But with these habits especially, they really don’t take much effort, but they do require a consistent consciousness of how you are working. So, try to keep each of these in mind as you get ready for, and then during, each of your work sessions 🫶

02:12 Batch By Project &amp; Task
06:27 Avoid Work

About Me

I&#x27;m a lawyer, part-time YouTuber, son, brother, startup founder, fiancé, black coffee drinker and plant dad. I graduated from Cambridge University (where I studied French and Spanish), topped my law school class and now work for a corporate law firm in London as a trainee solicitor (which takes up a lot of my time)!

Around that, I&#x27;m a big fan of discovering new ways of thinking, of balancing work with life, and of performing to the very best of my ability. Ohh, and being happy. And I try to share all that on this YouTube channel 😀

Fun fact: I believe we massively overplay the role of “natural talent” 😮 AND… I also believe that TOGETHER, WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF POSITIVITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND SUCCESS.
