      <title>Apple June Event Details Revealed! —WWDC 2021</title>
      <description><![CDATA[☎️ SAVE with Ting Mobile and get a $25 service credit 👉http://rene.ting.com

The invitations are out! The website… has been up for a while! The YouTube stream prep is still… strangely still MIA. But Apple has just released a Craig-ton of info about their upcoming June event. Yeah, WWDC 2021 is a GO! 

That’s where we’ll see iOS 15, iPadOS 15, tvOS 15, watchOS 8, macOS 12, privacy, security, HomeKit, HealthKit, ARKit, maybe AudioOS and accessibility, unless Spatial Audio and AssistiveTouch for Watch were just to clear the skies on that and leave room for everything else. 

Including maybe, just maybe, M1X MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini!
