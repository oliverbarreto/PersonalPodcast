      <title>Jordan Peterson Canceled: Warning On Good vs Evil, God, WW3, Andrew Tate, Porn &amp; Men Feeling Lost! - Tom Bilyeu</title>

Can humanity ever truly overcome evil? Can personal responsibility truly shape destiny in an interconnected world? Can society survive without traditional masculine virtues? Consider this your warning…

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson is a renowned psychologist, author, and online educator here to help us navigate the complex layers of thought, emotion, and spirit that compose the human condition. A Canadian clinical psychologist by profession, Jordan carved a unique path that intertwined academic rigor with deep reflections on morality, meaning, and belief. 

In today’s thought-provoking episode, Jordan is answering deep questions about life, purpose, and the potential for human transformation.

We touch on: 
- The line between good and evil
- Healthy vs. toxic masculinity
- Social media&#x27;s role in society&#x27;s rapid transformation
- Personal responsibility and the pursuit of meaning
- Cultural castration of men
- Human suffering and wrestling with God
- The challenges of conveying wisdom through religious narratives
- The OnlyFans dynamic 
- Genuine religious pursuit vs. exploitation for tyrannical ends
- Victimhood narratives and moral superiority

From the depths of human nature and the potential for totalitarianism, to the power of religious and philosophical insights in understanding the complexities of life, Jordan and I delve into the complex landscape of human psychology, ideology, and the search for meaning. 

Don’t miss this journey into the heart of what it means to be human, and confront your beliefs, fears, and moral compass in this episode of Impact Theory.

[1:11:47] Cracking Human Intelligence with LLMs 
[1:33:49] Message from Culture to “Castrate Yourself”
[1:51:02] Predators, oppressors, and power


Powerful Insights From Dr. Jordan B. Peterson:
&quot;If you don&#x27;t believe in something like the ultimate reality of evil, it&#x27;s just the Nazis went about things a slightly different way. Who&#x27;s to say what&#x27;s right or wrong?&quot;

&quot;It&#x27;s no wonder that we believe in the union of diversity when we believe that a man can be a woman. If we believe those things, there&#x27;s nothing we won&#x27;t swallow, no camel too big to go down our throats, no totalitarian lie we won&#x27;t rush to embody.&quot;

“There&#x27;s a vertical axis of orientation upward towards God, mediated by tradition, and there&#x27;s a horizontal axis that&#x27;s part of the ongoing conversation and consensus of the moment.&quot;

&quot;And so the world of images is going to have the same networked structure as the world of words that the LLMs have modeled. Soon the LLms will be able to model the world of images and soon they&#x27;ll be able to lay them on top of one another.&quot;

&quot;...everything you give away, you&#x27;ll get back if you give it away in the right spirit.&quot;

&quot;You give more than you&#x27;re called upon to give, even to your enemies. Why? Because there is no better strategy than that by any stretch of the imagination…How could you possibly put anything in a more solid bank than in the goodwill you generated in the embodied imaginations of other people? That&#x27;s the kingdom.&quot;

I have never put out an urgent episode before. I recorded this conversation 5 days ago with the incredible Mo Gawdat. After our conversation, I realised how urgent this information is and how critical it is that we are all aware of the super-intelligence of AI.

Mo Gawdat is the Former Chief Business Officer for Google X, an AI expert, a best-selling author and a passionate podcaster.

Mo spoke to me about AI. Most people bury their head in the sand when it comes to this topic, Mo is trying to change that. He believes that AI can be used for good, however we all need to work together to make that happen. 

This episode is incredibly important. If you have any loved ones or people you care about, make sure you send this on to them. I urge you to listen carefully and then take action.

      <title>Designing a Customer-Centric Business Model - Harvard Innovation Labs</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Simply defined, a business model is how you deliver value to customers and how you make money in return. The most successful business models capture value in concert with the customer. In this session, originally presented in-person at the Harvard Innovation Labs, you’ll learn how to do just that. Michael Skok, founding partner at Underscore VC, will share how to identify your core business value and align your business model to your customer’s success.

      <title>CIA Spy On WW3, Jeffrey Epstein, Israel-Hamas, AI &amp; Social Media Brainwashing | Andrew Bustamante - Tom Bilyeu</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Transform Your Life in 90 Days: Take The Impact 90 Challenge  https://bit.ly/47kCfrZ

This episode is sponsored by Aura. You can try Aura for free for two weeks at https://bit.ly/3KJd7mC. The Smart, Simple Way To Stay Safe Online.

We&#x27;re delving deep into the unsettling realities of our chaotic world with former CIA spy, Andrew Bustamante. As we face an increasingly complex and confusing era, understanding the tactics and strategies used to manipulate public opinion has never been more crucial.

In this episode, we examine the distressing prospect of America turning against itself and the increasing potential for war. Andrew shares his ideas on how external attacks on our system could ironically unify us, but also how these threats are being weaponized to destabilize America. We look at the concept of World War 3 and it not being fought on traditional battlefields, but through proxy wars and influence campaigns that target our resources, dominance, and global standing.

It’s near impossible that you are not impacted on various levels by the role of the internet in accelerating the velocity of information. We’re in a time where enabling psychological manipulation on an unprecedented scale is happening right now as we speak.

How will you protect yourself? Will you learn how to think through novel problems and utilize opposing narratives against each other to discover the truth?

By the end of this episode, you’ll learn how to anchor yourself, make clear-headed decisions, and avoid the trap of emotional decision-making. In listening to both sides of the political spectrum and finding common ground, we can cut through the &#x27;fog of war&#x27; and discern truth from noise.

Andrew Bustamante delivers invaluable insights from his time as a CIA spy, offering a unique perspective on the truth about Jeffrey Epstein, conspiracy theories, porn and sexpionage that will shock you!

Powerful Insights From Andrew Bustamante:

“At our core we are a fighting culture. It’s one of our biggest flaws and it’s one of our biggest strengths.”

“Emotional decision making is what the human brain wants to do, [...] because emotional decisions require less cognitive ability, less calories, less time and is easier…”

“Truth includes facts and beliefs, and facts excludes beliefs.”

“The way that you defeat extremism is by taking out the first step in the ladder.”

“When most people reference World War 3 happening, what they’re actually talking about is a nuclear war similar to how World War 2 ended. Wars evolve like people evolve, and if you’ve seen the evolution of technology you can imagine how much more advanced World War 3 would be than World War 2…”

      <title>DevTalles PodCast - 141: Problemas comunes a los que se enfrentan los desarrolladores de software - Fernando Herrera</title>
      <description><![CDATA[🖥️ En este episodio quiero que tengamos presente 14 de los problemas más comunes a los que nos enfrentaremos: cuando estemos trabajando en el #Desarrollo de una #Aplicación.
#Software

📚 Puedes acceder a mi curso actualizado de Angular aquí: https://fernando-herrera.com/#/search/Angular:%20De%20cero%20a%20experto

🅰️ La nueva sintaxis no es común aún, por lo que si tienen que trabajar en aplicaciones de Angular, lo harán de la forma tradicional con módulos. Además esta versión es retro-compatible, y podemos ir progresivamente usando las nuevas características. Estos añadidos al framework buscan hacerlo moderno, más rápido y amigable. Al final, esta nueva sintaxis es como cuando React propuso los hooks y functional components en lugar de clases, o cuando Vue.Js introdujo el Composition API sobre el options API. 

👉🏻  Y puedes obtener Acceso Anticipado a mi curso actualizado de Next como beneficio de la Suscripción DevTalles PRO: https://cursos.devtalles.com/courses/nextjs#precios

También puedes adquirir el curso anterior, y cuando se finalice la grabación en unos meses, obtendrás el update gratuito en ambas plataformas:  https://fernando-herrera.com/#/search/Next

      <title>The 6 Habits Of HIGHLY EFFECTIVE People You Can Copy! (CHANGE EVERYTHING) | Brendon Burchard - Tom Bilyeu</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Build IRONCLAD discipline in this free workshop: https://bit.ly/3pMVl6J

On Today&#x27;s Episode: 

It’s easy to admire people that have reached extraordinary levels of success, it’s hard to imagine what it takes to get there. Passing off someone’s excellence and success as unattainable for ourselves is a b.s. and it’s not what we’re about at Impact Theory. 

Your beliefs are malleable and what you believe about yourself matters. How you decide to live your life and show today matters also and if you’re not happy with the way you show up or how you’re living your life then do something about it.

Brendon Burchard is one of the world’s leading high performance coaches that has impacted and trained millions of people globally. His online personal growth platform is dedicated to teaching people how to bring the joy, live with intention, love the life you live, and matter to yourself and others everyday because you show up to go all-in on whatever you decide.

You’ve heard what it takes to be successful, but very few people share how to get beyond passion and shoot for obsession to attain insane levels of success, but today we are, so let’s go.

SHOW NOTES:

0:00 | Introduction to Brendon Burchard
2:22 | Generate the Energy You Want
10:15 | Raise Necessity with Obsession
15:51 | These 2 Things BUILD Your Identity
26:33 | Build These Skills Achieve More
35:47 | Honor the Struggle to Win

QUOTES:

“If you’re not a fun person when you&#x27;re broke, you’re not going to be that much more fun when you’re rich.” [4:00]

“High performers are generating the energy, and that means the mental, emotional and physical energy, that they feel is necessary to serve with excellence in a certain situation.” [9:45]

“People don’t want to exude that much passion which becomes obsession because they’re fearful of their obsessions.” [12:36] 

“If no one thinks you’re crazy you’re not yet operating to the outer limits of your potential.” [13:43]

“Being obsessed about something that gives you no feedback is not scary, being obsessed about something, like trying to make an impact in the world you’re going to get feedback.” [14:39]

“If you want to win, your identity has to be tied into that thing in which you are trying to succeed at and give to, and that takes a lot of guts to ut yourself all in…” [18:32]

“This is who I’m going to be and I’m going to build into that, and it is necessary for me to become that person.” [26:22]

“High performers are consistently seeking clarity in ‘who do I want to be?’ [...] in every situation.” [31:15]

“I don’t want a friction free life, [...] The journey to greatness begins the moment that our deep desires for comfort and for ease are overpowered by our desires to connect and contribute.”  [40:08]

“Determine what the questions at the end of your life are going to be.” [42:49]

      <title>MEGATHREAT: Why AI Is So Dangerous &amp; How It Could Destroy Humanity | Mo Gawdat - Tom Bilyeu</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Listen to Impact Theory on Amazon Music: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/9e0db1b9-b46c-4e50-a9c5-add34b0ffe00/impact-theory-with-tom-bilyeu?ref=dm_sh_nzgPULGEOD2WFqOCd38MsElYP

Restart Your Life in 7 Days: http://bit.ly/42KM8OR

After reading Mo Gawdat’s book, Scary Smart, I knew right away this conversation was a must. As I think about AI’s capabilities – the good, the bad and possibly terrifying, I realize how serious this moment is in history for humanity.

Mo Gawdat is the former chief business officer for Google X and has built a monumental career in the tech industry working with the biggest names to reshape and reimagine the world as we know it. From IBM to Microsoft, Mo has lived at the cutting edge of technology and has taken a strong stance that AI is a bigger threat to humanity than global warming.

The AI dilemma is reshaping our future whether you’re in favor of it or not. The question is, are we even close to being prepared for humanity’s collision with artificial intelligence?

Strap in for the ride, we’re diving headfirst into this conversation and uncovering the alarming truth about how vulnerable we actually are and what that means for the next decade ahead.

QUOTES:

“It really is about a point of no return. Where if we cross that point of no return we have very little chance to bring the genie back into the bottle.”

“There is no shutting down AI, there is no reversing it, there is no stopping development of it.”

“We’ve never created a nuclear weapon that can create nuclear weapons.”

“The growth on the next chip in your phone is going to be a million times more than the computer that put people on the moon.”

“When we ask computers to communicate, at first they communicate like we tell them, but if they&#x27;re intelligent enough, they&#x27;ll start to say, ‘that&#x27;s too slow.’”

“One of our better scenarios, believe it or not, is that AI ignores us altogether.”

“Technology today can influence one human at a time.”

Build IRONCLAD discipline in this FREE workshop: https://bit.ly/3RUnYux

On Today&#x27;s Episode:

Do you enjoy the snooze alarm game? A lot of people you know including yourself do. It’s kind of fun but mostly torture. For 30 to 60 minutes, depending on your level of expertise, you get to see how many times you will hit the snooze button and sleep in 5 or 10 minute intervals before having to jump out of bed and mad dash through the morning to get ready. 

Every day, you wake up exhausted, you don’t get to the most important thing you told yourself the night before you would do first thing in the morning, your energy is low before noon and by 3 PM you’re begging yourself for a nap.

The key to breaking this cycle to start waking up at the time you want and need to is having the habits and routines built in place that make you so efficient that success becomes inevitable.

You don’t have to struggle every morning to get up early, you don’t need to set an alarm every night before bed to get up in the morning on time, and you don’t have to suffer through your days forever tired.

This is the video you need to hear to truly understand, how hardcore is hardcore for Tom Bilyeu when it comes to being the founder of a billion dollar company?

A few simple strategies you can start with right now are:

Go to bed same time (every day)
Do not use an alarm
Sleep as much as you need (it’s that important)

QUOTES:

“Your life will change forever the moment you decide to go to us early and really attack your day.”

“The snooze alarm says that you’ve not gotten control of your evenings.”

“You don’t need time to unwind, you are creating a torture cycle for yourself. You need a method for shutting your brain off.”

“I define truth as the thing that most efficiently moves you towards your goal.”

“My life is an exact reflection of my choices and that I made my day a little bit worst by not doing what I said I was going to do.”

“Boredom kills more dreams than failure I promise you.”

      <title>Chat GPT, The FUTURE Of AI And Is It The End Of Human Civilization? | Tom Bilyeu - Tom Bilyeu</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Click here to download your FREE guide to 100x YOUR EFFICIENCY IN 10 EASY STEPS: https://bit.ly/3F8qOJL

Chat GPT AI went from 0 to over 100Million users in less than 2 months. AI is super fucking dangerous, but it’s inevitable, will make our lives better, and you should CAREFULLY love it. 

Is AI dangerous? Next to thermonuclear war and an asteroid strike, I’d say it’s the most radically dangerous threat that we face as a species. Buuuuut I’m still super excited. And by the end of this video you will be too.

If you’re terrified of AI right now, you’re rational. If you’re not at least worried it will take a wrong turn into James Cameron territory, you’re not paying attention. To paraphrase Elon Musk, the human endeavor to create AI could be the first step towards a technological utopia or a demon summoning circle. It’s not clear which way it will go. But one thing is for sure, we will not control it. And he’s right, but the truth is, the genie is out of the bottle, and we’re going to have to deal with it.  

For the most part our insatiable drive for progress is awesome. The modern world really is a miracle. We have buses that fly for the love of god. And if people like Eric Weinstein are correct, our thirst for progress will lead us to building technology that doesn’t just allow us to fly around the world, it will give us the ability to manipulate time and space itself - propelling us well beyond our solar system at faster than light speeds. 


I fear it will be a bit of both.

AI, which simply stands for Artificial Intelligence, is getting smart. Really smart. And AI doesn’t have to outsmart us by much to completely dominate us. Let me give you an example for scale: A moron is technically someone with an IQ of about 70. The average IQ in the US is 98. Einstein was estimated to be 160. And according to the Guiness book of World Records, the highest IQ ever recorded came in at a whopping 210. That means that a super genius is only 3 times smarter than a moron. But Einstein, who was actually only 2.3 times smarter than a moron, had insights that gave birth to nuclear power and nuclear bombs, not to mention lasers, GPS, and a whole lot more. Said another way, a little intelligence goes a loooooooong way. 

Nuclear warheads are scary enough, but AI isn’t going to be a little smarter than Einstein, it’s going to be a LOT smarter. Not 5 times smarter or 10 times or even 10,000 times smarter. We’re talking millions of times smarter. 

Despite the reality of all the bad stuff that’s coming, here are three traps we must avoid.
1. Burying our heads in the sand. 
2. Panicking. 
3. Trying to abolish AI.

Panicking is the same as actively taking your own intelligence offline. When you panic, blood leaves your prefrontal cortex, which is the seat of high level cognition. Therefore it actually makes you dumber. And in the face of artificial super intelligence that strikes me as a very bad idea. 

This is going to be the bleakest thing that I say today, but if we’re going to walk a wise path forward, we’ve got to face all of this. And, as they say, it’s darkest right before dawn, which I promise is coming. But first, here’s the reality you will instantly know to be true - when humans find powerful things we use them. 

Because AI as a weapon is a zero sum game. If only one nation develops it, it will be winner take all. And no one can risk an adversary getting Artificial Super Intelligence while they sit around entering funny prompts into ChatGPT. 

In the short term you need to do three things:

1. Reframe your thinking around AI. Don’t see it as the enemy. See it as a tool. You’re not going to be replaced by AI, at least not yet. You’re going to be replaced by a human using AI. Be the human that replaces others.
2. Figure out how AI is going to disrupt you. Face it head on. Don’t run. Don’t hide. Identify your vulnerabilities and shore up your skill set.
3. Identify all of the AI tools that are relevant to you and master them. Learn absolutely everything you can.

Remember, this is the very beginning of a very aggressive revolution. Moving quickly gives you advantages.

First of all, let me acknowledge that I’m a pundit here, not an expert. While we’re working feverishly to integrate AI into our company’s workflow, I’m not the guy who can tell you how AI works under the hood. So what follows will be me thinking out loud based on what I’ve learned from the experts in my attempts to use AI in both my daily life and the daily operations of my company.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Neuroscientist: This Simple Skill Will Make You More Powerful In Life | Andrew Huberman

Also, in this video Neuroscientist - Andrew Huberman explains the 5 things in life which cannot be replaced.

Neuroscientist: There&#x27;s NO replacement for these 5 Things | Andrew Huberman. 2023

      <title>4 ONE-MINUTE Habits That Save Me 20+ Hours a Week - Time Management For Busy People - Liam Porritt</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The first 100 people to download Endel will get a free week of audio experiences - https://app.adjust.com/b8wxub6?campaign=liamporritt_January2023&amp;adgroup=youtube

In our busy lives, a few hours a week means time for a date, or a few hours of self-love pruning in the bath - so imagine what you could do with 10, 20 or even more extra time each week 🤯 

Well, from reading some of the best time management books out there, these are my top 4 quick habits to efficiently manage your time, which save me hours each week 🙌 They are simple, but hugely effective techniques to make the most of our 16 or so waking hours a day, and honestly are some of the core techniques that allow me to keep up a demanding career as a corporate lawyer, while running multiple businesses on the side 👨‍💻

The key to these habits is (as with all habits) consistency… kinda obvious, I know. But with these habits especially, they really don’t take much effort, but they do require a consistent consciousness of how you are working. So, try to keep each of these in mind as you get ready for, and then during, each of your work sessions 🫶

About Me

I&#x27;m a lawyer, part-time YouTuber, son, brother, startup founder, fiancé, black coffee drinker and plant dad. I graduated from Cambridge University (where I studied French and Spanish), topped my law school class and now work for a corporate law firm in London as a trainee solicitor (which takes up a lot of my time)!

Around that, I&#x27;m a big fan of discovering new ways of thinking, of balancing work with life, and of performing to the very best of my ability. Ohh, and being happy. And I try to share all that on this YouTube channel 😀

Fun fact: I believe we massively overplay the role of “natural talent” 😮 AND… I also believe that TOGETHER, WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF POSITIVITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND SUCCESS.
